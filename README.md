# hello-world

Hi,

Jeremy here. I'm currently learning Python for computational thinking. I'm interested in data analysis. I'm working on a qualitative analysis project using RQDA within the R platform, and I would like to learn to effectively use the advanced functions that R offers. I would like to learn more about hardware and engineering.
